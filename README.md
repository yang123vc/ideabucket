libyal is a collection of libraries that are used to access various data formats, such as the OLE Compound File or NT File System. The original use case for the libraries is for analyzing data formats or their content for analysis in the context of digital forensics and incident response (DFIR).

The name libyal was initially a pun on the naming theme of the various library projects. 

The ideabucket project contains a collection of ideas for future libyal projects.
